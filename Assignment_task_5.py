#1. Write a program to Python find the values which is not divisible 3 but is should be a multiple of 7. Make sure to use only higher order function.

initial = list(map(int, range(1,50)))
second = list(filter(lambda x: (x%7 == 0), initial))
final = list(filter(lambda x: (x%3 != 0), second))
print(final)




#2. 	Write a program in Python to  multiple the element of list by itself using a traditional function and pass the function to map to complete the operation.

def multiply(n):
    return n*n

demo = [2, 5, 7, 3, 1, 9]
print(list(map(multiply, demo)))




#3. Write a program to Python find out the character in a string which is uppercase using list comprehension.

demo_string = "hEllO sTriNg"
demo_result = [i for i in demo_string if i.isupper()]
print(demo_result)




#4. 	Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should maps the students with their respective subjects. Let’s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension. HINT-Use Zip function also
#Student = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']
#capital = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']

student = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']
capital = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']

res_2 = {k:v for (k,v) in zip(student, capital)}
print(res_2)





#6. 	Write a program in Python using generators to reverse the string. Input String = “Consultadd Training”

#Face 1 method
input_string = "Consultadd Training"

result = (i for i in input_string[::-1])
print(result)
b = ""
while True:
    try:    
        a = next(result)
        b = b+a
    except:
        break

print(b)

#Face 2 method

def rev(x):
    yield x[::-1]

res_2 = rev(input_string)
print(res_2)
while True:
    try:
        a = next(res_2)
        print(a)
    except:
        break





#7. 	Write any example on decorators.

def make_pretty(function):
    def inner():
        print("I got decorated")
        func()
    return inner

@make_pretty
def ordinary():
    print("I am ordinary")

ordinary()





#8. 	Learn about What is FRONT END and its Technologies and Tools
#Make sure to mention at least 5 top notch technologies of Frontend.
#Also mentioned the name of companies using those 5 technologies individually

            The organization offered its clients with newer, more sophisticated features by entirely re-engineering their mobile application. 
            Node.js’ asynchronous I/O mechanism along with its single threaded event loop models can help Walmart handle concurrent requests
